## input
3 2 # n,m

## question
There are beads with number 1 to n. 
Find out all cases of picking up beads m times (allow repetition)

import sys
sys.stdin=open("input.txt","rt")
input=sys.stdin.readline # read fast
# if input is string type, use as "s=input().rstrip()" 

def DFS(L):

    if L==m:
        for x in a:
            print(x, end=' ')
        print()
        cnt+=1
        # Be careful to use 'return'
        # If you don't want to spread branches then use reutrn
        # However if you are at the endpoint (end node), the function will be closed with 'return'
    else:
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            a.append(i)
            DFS(L+1)
            a.pop(-1)

    DFS(0) # don't need to put list as parameter
    print(cnt)
