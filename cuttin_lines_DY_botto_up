## input
7 # length n

## question
If you want to cut given network line with length n into lines of length 1 or 2,
find out how many ways to cut the given line.
For example, if you have 4m network line, you can think of these 5 ways.
1) 1m+1m+1m+1m
2) 2m+1m+1m
3) 1m+1m+2m
4) 1m+2m+1m
5) 2m+2m

import sys
sys.stdin=open("input.txt","rt")

n=int(input())
dy=[0]*(n+1)
dy[1]=1
dy[2]=2
for i in range(3, n+1):
    dy[i]=dy[i-1]+dy[i-2]
print(dy[n])
