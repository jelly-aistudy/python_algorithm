## question
Anagram means that two strings have same components (alphabet and its numbers) 
In this case, order doesn't matter.
Figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not.

import sys
sys.stdin=open("input.txt","rt")

a=input()
b=input()
c=dict()
d=dict()

for x in a:
    if x in c:
        c[x]+=1
    else:
        c[x]=1

for y in b:
    if y in d: 
        d[y]+=1
    else:
        d[y]=1

for n in c:
    if n in d and c[n]==d[n]:
        c[n]=0 
        d[n]=0
    else:
        print("NO")
        break
else:
    print("YES")
